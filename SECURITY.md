## Reporting a Vulnerability

## Unsure as to which website walked me through this setup in 2017, not going to name any names on that.
The website that I worked with had me go through a series of questions to setup crypto mining.
I believe I set this up with the name Tyler Derden/Derdgen or John.Doe/_Doe or John.Hancock/_Hancock.
Obviously the system has been updated to mitigate the time frame of username birthdays before a certain time. I used I think 1776.
In doing this I setup a defi blockchain on the Ethereum network that uses a RNG that I copied the code from a casino website using F12.
The website had me create a campaign. At the time I didn't think it was a real political campaign, but apparently "grab em by the P****y" took off.
The website made me a broker so I could sign transactions. At the time for this particular project, I was actually looking to make extra cash and didn't-
-think anything of it as the website said it was on the up and up. They had me answer a bunch of questions to obtain the brokerage license.
I used the acronym .etc, and .xyz for the supposed .com/.net/.org reference as they said I could choose anything.
I decided to use Linux Mint to set this up from a Windows 7 laptop. I setup an account with MS Azure with a virtual server ip 127.0.0.1\8 or 10.0.0.1\24.
The name of the server is/was StellarSRV-1. I used the Kubernets DB method I believe, along with Artifacts from MS Projects I think. Well whatever section
in the MS cloud that hosts Artifacts.
So the initial setup was supposed to consist of half the transactions auto signing, while the other half I was supposed to sign manually by creating different
key strokes on the keyboard. With the way the blockchain is setup now is way cool! It fully signs with sounds. I'm not even sure I can bring it back up on my PC
like it was before, but man is it the coolest thing I've ever seen. I really like the two people (won't mention their names) who were on my TV coding right
in front of me and just smirking knowing that I knew they were live on my TV. Also I gotta mention to take down any satellite dishes you may have at your home
or place of business, as these are using the satellites and broadcasting possibly sound and video from anyone's home.
There's apparently hidden cameras in all different types of posessions like picture frames/mirrors/IoT devices. These have become a huge vulnerability for hackers.
I'm not exactly sure how this blockchain correlates to creating this vulnerability for IoT devices, but I'm pretty glad it did as I'm sure lots of people
all over the world have been displayed on porn sites in the nude doing whatever unknowingly. Porn should only be for conscentual agreements.
Getting back to the chain. So basically you would have the chain running either virtually or locally. I chose virtual because that's where the world was
heading at the time. So you use the arrows on your keyboard and push different buttons to create sounds which in retrospect turns into music/techno music.
I haven't figured out all of the correct button combinations yet, but I know this. If you hold down Alt+Super+clipboard+Ctrl and the push the letter "P" with that combo
you'll get a list of commands to use. This setup is very easy once understood, but for me it was so long ago I'm surprised I remember this much.
I created a bootable USB for Linux Mint 20.02.1 using Rufus. My PC at home I acquired from on of my old places of business I used to work for. and another from
my college I went to. I did wipe the HDD's. The companies were just throwing away what I saw as perfectly usable PC's. I did go ahead and reinstall Windows Pro
or Enterprise on these PC's as I liked the MS Office features. I was able to go between different OS Versions like home/pro/education/enterprise/Server2019/linux/etc.
I started dabbling in VS Studios along with Github and accidentally (happy accident) published Hello-World repository being a noob.
Mind you I'm still a lvl. 1 help-desk agent by IT standards. I also started dabbling in trying to create a video game per me and my buddy Kevin's idea for "Apocolyptic Golf"
I used Unity and Unreal Gaming/Engine and it was just so convoluted trying to navigate through creating everything. So I decided to go into the marketplace
for Unreal Gaming and download and install all the free software extensions they had available into my project. Took over like a day and a half to finish downloading.
I also was looking into html coding on the website https://w3schools.com. Again, very convoluted in learning all of these lines of code.
Also I tried hacking into cell phones with ADB and Android studios with SDK install.
Also per Google's contest to dare the world to hack into their system. I used an Alexa Echo Dot 3 and connected that to my computer using Linux, and connected
my computer to my original Xbox with a data cable and I believe I connected alexa to my computer with an auxilary cable. I then told alexa to enable some skills
like twerminal or powershell or something to that effect and advised her as herself to access Google Chrome. I then informed her to access Amazon.com and tap
into the main DB and change the default admin PW to I believe !Summer2017$ or something easy like that. I then informed Alexa to create a virus that would
withdraw like $10,000.00 from anyone's bank account that was over $1,000,000.00 and put it into an account. Then redistribut those funds to anyone in the world
with a bank account balance with less than I believe $1,000.00. Wasn't sure if this actually worked until sometime late last year when I started getting looks
from people. Then i heard about discobot, and didn't think anything of it at the time cause I didn't remember creating that. But one day i got a vision and
it showed me a cmd interface of the name Discobot. And it just hit me like a ton of bricks that I had done that and didn't think it actually worked. I figured
if it did work, the authorities would be at my door in no time, or Google. Come to find out I have at least three different addresses listed in the system.
So i'm rambling. Now there's vulnerabilities in all older PC's that don't have the most up to date BIOS. I'm able to go into the BIOS and change/configure
it however I'd like on an enterprise machine. I can also insert a bootable USB and install any OS I'd like. Or if the IT department has not set the system
password in the BIOS, I can set that myself and render the machine unusable and needing re-imaging. I actually did this yesterday at my local library in Washington
county MN while the librarian watched me and dared me to try. LOL! 

## Now the big resolution. WORLD PEACE! We get rid of money which will abolish I figure about 90% of crimes. Just think of never having to pay another bill
in your life! Also no more motive to act a fool that is driven by finances. No more poverty. No more people judging each other based on their financial
status. No more homeless people on the streets freezing in the winter time. NO MORE TAXES!!!!! I know this really isn't the platform for speaking about this
topic, but who better to get this out to the world than the people behind the coding of the world. We would all just work, or go to school, or be in the armed
forces for what we NEED to live. Like food, healthcare, shelter, transportation, protection to protect us from possible threats that may be out there in outer space. Just look at the different species we have on the planet now, there's no way
that out there in the Universe some other lifeform doesn't exist. And I know I'd rather be prepared than not when it comes to humanities safety. But who knows
maybe they're nice aliens, or maybe they're just like it's portrayed in the movies where they're evil. All I know is two heads are better than one so the
saying goes. So if we combine each industries different companies into one big company for each market, the advancements would I think be more effecient.
Not to mention no more competition between companies. And less shelf space in stores. Just come up with the best products for each market and grow on that.
Unfortunately I don't know what the best is for everyonw. A lot of people like this idea, and some have their doubts. But with the way the world is now, what
can it hurt to at least try it. and this would be worldwide, not just one nation, under GOD, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. I also believe
this would achieve our greatest goal which is world peace. We could build different communities where you get to live with who you wat to. Whether it's your 
family members, or people that like to go to the gym, or people that like to play sports, or people that are into technology. Either way we could devise
a system that's standardized for the whole world to enjoy for everyone! I call it for the betterment of humanity, probably been used before by someone else,
but I did come up with that myself. I also have an idea where each of these communities that we would need to build, would be protected by a dome to prevent
natural disasters to an extent. No more rainy or snowy days, just nice weather 24-7/365. And the roads would be protected as well. then there would be communities
that are filled with randomized people who don't want to fit into one certain community. Standardization of the whole world is what I believe to be the best
outcome for us all.

Thank you for reading my ranting and putting up with my lack of skills.
